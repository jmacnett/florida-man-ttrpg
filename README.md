# FLORIDA MAN TTRPG

#### A journey into the world of that shittiest of super heroes, Florida Man.

It's hurricane season, and the world around your home in florida has gone mad.  Some are evacuating, some are barricading themselves indoors, some see this as an opportunity, and some are merely planning to get shitfaced and worry about tomorrow tomorrow.  Into this swirling maelstrom of humanity comes you, and optionally your compatriots, as you aim to get the fuck out of Florida before the hurricane hits.  

But beware! Nature is far from the only hazard you may encounter, in this cesspool of convenience store criminals, jetski enthusiasts, alcoholics, bible thumpers, cops, and the snarkiest reporters known to man.

Will you escape?  Or will you become a permanent fixture of Florida just before the rains sweep it into sweet, sweet oblivion (for at least a month or so)?

The time to decide is now.

## Stats

### Abilities:
Abilities are actions a player can take during an interation or during combat.  All ability rolls are taken with a D20; the results are a combination of their baseline scores in each ability plus the d20 roll, compared to the difficulty class (DC) of the action in question.  The DC is assigned at the GM's discretion for world interations; in combat, this will be determined at the start of the interation based on the antagonist(s) in question.

###### Basic abilities:
- Attack
- Persuasion
- Perception

### States:
States are what controls the health and intelligence of your Florida Man, and also control the outcome of the game to an extent.

###### Statuses:
- HP: The amount of health your florida man has.  Every player starts with 10 HP, and this is (normally) the maximum health your character can have.  If you lose all of your HP, your florida man drops into unconciousness.  Certain circumstances (read as: illegal narcotics of various provenances) can temporarily raise this score above 10, but those effects are always temporary, and will typically carry a penalty after they wear off.
- Toxicity: Every player starts at a baseline toxicity of 5.  For every failed interaction in the world requiring an ability roll (or any combat that results in the player losing or running away), you gain 1 point of toxicity, as your Florida Man seeks comfort in their Drug of Choice.
    - If your toxicity reaches 10 points, you are inebriated, and must roll at disadvantage on all ability checks except attack.
    - If your toxicity reaches 15 points, you drop to 1 hit point, and must nap to bring your toxicity back down.
    - Recouperation: For every **successful** ability roll, you lose one point of toxicity, as your Florida Man realizes that the world isn't quite as dark and cold as he thought.  ``NOTE``: If you reach a toxicity of 0, the rest of the party must immediately turn on you and attack until you either fall unconcious, or partake in a drug of choice again.

## Gameplay

Basic gameplay is like most TTRPGS; the GM will set the scene, and the player(s) will interact with NPCS as they attempt to escape Florida before the hurricane comes.
