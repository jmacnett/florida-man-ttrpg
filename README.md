# FLORIDA MAN TTRPG

#### A journey into the world of that shittiest of super heroes, Florida Man.

It's hurricane season, and the world around your home in florida has gone mad.  Some are evacuating, some are barricading themselves indoors, some see this as an opportunity, and some are merely planning to get shitfaced and worry about tomorrow tomorrow.  Into this swirling maelstrom of humanity comes you, and optionally your compatriots, as you aim to get the fuck out of Florida before the hurricane hits.  

But beware! Nature is far from the only hazard you may encounter, in this cesspool of convenience store criminals, jetski enthusiasts, alcoholics, bible thumpers, cops, and the snarkiest reporters known to man.

Will you escape?  Or will you become a permanent fixture of Florida just before the rains sweep it into sweet, sweet oblivion (for at least a month or so)?

The time to decide is now.

## Stats

### Attributes:
Attributes are values that affect actions a player can take during an interation or during combat.  All ability rolls are taken with a D20; the results are a combination of their baseline scores in each ability plus the d20 roll, compared to the difficulty class (DC) of the action in question.  The DC is assigned at the GM's discretion for world interations; in combat, this will be determined at the start of the interation based on the antagonist(s) in question.

##### Basic Attributes:
- Attack: ability to determine if you can hit another being successfully
- Persuasion: ability to cajole others into believing you
- Perception: ability to tell if you're being watched, or if something seems out of place
- Avoidance: ability to run away from a given scenario (combat or otherwise)

### Toxicity:
Toxicity is the primary stat for all Florida Men.  Every player starts at a baseline toxicity of 5.  

- For every failed interaction in the world requiring an ability roll (or any combat that results in the player losing or running away), you gain 1 point of toxicity, as your Florida Man seeks comfort in their Drug of Choice.
- For every **successful** ability roll (or any combat that the player wins), you lose one point of toxicity, as your Florida Man revels in his natural charisma and obvious superiority.  
- If your toxicity reaches 10 points, you are inebriated, and must roll at disadvantage on all ability checks except attack.
- If your toxicity reaches 15 points, you fall asleep, and must nap to bring your toxicity back down (1 point per hour removed).
- Conversely, if you reach a toxicity of 0, the rest of the party must IMMEDIATELY turn on you and attack until you either fall unconcious, or partake in a Drug of Choice again.  If you escape, or if all members of the party fail to attack you successfully, you gain advantage on all rolls until a successful attack occurs, or you imbibe ANY Drug of Choice option (not just your own).

## Gameplay/Rules

Basic gameplay is like most TTRPGS; the GM will set the scene, and the player(s) will interact with NPCS as they attempt to escape Florida before the hurricane comes.

Gameplay continues until any of the following occur:
- the players successfully escape Florida (success)
- The hurricane arrives (failure)
- the players all fall unconcious simultaneously (failure)
- the players are all arrested simultaneously (failure)

** TO BE CONTINUED **

potentially pending:
- common npc types (cops, gators, karens, other florida men, clones of ron desantis)
- more detailed/involved combat?
-
