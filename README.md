# FLORIDA MAN TTRPG

#### A journey into the world of that shittiest of super heroes, Florida Man.

It's hurricane season, and the world around your home in florida has gone mad.  Some are evacuating, some are barricading themselves indoors, some see this as an opportunity, and some are merely planning to get shitfaced and worry about tomorrow tomorrow.  Into this swirling maelstrom of humanity comes you, and optionally your compatriots, as you aim to get the fuck out of Florida before the hurricane hits.  

But beware! Nature is far from the only hazard you may encounter, in this cesspool of convenience store criminals, jetski enthusiasts, alcoholics, bible thumpers, cops, and the snarkiest reporters known to man.

Will you escape?  Or will you become a permanent fixture of Florida just before the rains sweep it into sweet, sweet oblivion (for at least a month or so)?

The time to decide is now.
